# Portfolio
My Portfolio is a professionally designed, minimalist website that showcases my academic and technical journey as a 4th-year Electrical and Electronics Engineering (EEE) student at Sri Venkateswara College of Engineering (SVCE), Tirupati, with a CGPA of 8.9. Built using HTML and CSS, it features a clean, responsive layout with a vibrant green color palette, creating a modern and approachable tech aesthetic. The portfolio highlights my core skills in Python, C, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Arduino, Data Structures, React.js, and PLC. It showcases key projects, including an Automatic Braking System Prototype developed with Arduino to enhance vehicle safety and a responsive Basic Calculator Web Application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Essential features include a downloadable ATS-friendly resume for easy access by recruiters and a Google Forms-powered feedback form to collect visitor input. Deployable on free platforms like Netlify, this portfolio serves as a dynamic, professional platform to present my technical expertise and passion for software development and embedded systems to potential employers in the tech industry.
